	<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
	<p>The concept of power pose originates from a Psychology study from 2010 which suggested that holding an expansive pose can change hormone levels and increase risk-taking behavior. Follow-up experiments suggested that expansive poses incidentally imposed by the design of an environment lead to more dishonest behaviors. Jansen and Hornbæk applied the concept in the form of incidental power poses within HCI and reported an at best very small effect.</p>
	<p>In this article we re-analyze the data of their second experiment to consider different priors varying on two dimensions: degree of informedness and strength of belief. We discuss the robustness of the Jansen and Hornbæk's findings in light of our extended analysis.</p>

	<h2 id="experiment">Experiment: Inclined Tabletop</h2>

	<p>Our experiment is inspired by experiment 2 from Yap et. al <dt-cite key="yap2013ergonomics"></dt-cite>. There, participants’ incidental posture was imposed by either arranging their tools around a large (0.6 m<sup>2</sup>) or a small (0.15 m<sup>2</sup>) workspace. Yap et al. study investigated the effect of incidental postures imposed by the different workspaces on people’s dishonesty, whereas we applied the paradigm to risk-taking behavior which is a common behavioral measure in multiple studies on explicit power poses <dt-cite key="cesario2013bodies,carney2010power,ranehill2015assessing"></dt-cite>. These previous studies all gave binary choices to participants, asking them whether they were willing to take a single gamble <dt-cite key="cesario2013bodies,carney2010power"></dt-cite> or to make several risky choices in both gain and loss domain  <dt-cite key="ranehill2015assessing"></dt-cite> using examples taken from Tversky and Kahneman <dt-cite key="tversky1981framing"></dt-cite>. There, participants’ binary response was the measure for risk-taking. We opted for a more continuous measure for risk-taking as it results in higher resolution for responses, and used the balloon analog risk task (BART), a behavioral measure for risk-taking propensity  <dt-cite key="lejuez2002evaluation"></dt-cite>. We again study one main factor: incidental posture with two levels, expansive and constrictive, implemented as two variations of the same graphical user interface <span class="highlight">(see Figure 7)</span>. To keep comfort constant across conditions, we used a slightly inclined 60” tabletop display instead of a wall display so that participants in both conditions could rest their arms while performing the task <span class="highlight">(see Figure 1C&D)</span>.</p>

	<h3>Participants</h3>

	<p>We recruited a total of 80 participants (42 women, 38 men, mean age 26) in two batches. Similar to experiment 1, we initially recruited 40 participants. A Bayes factor analysis <!-- enter citations --> at that point indicated that our data was not sensitive enough to draw any conclusions, and we decided to increase the total number of participants to 80. As is common in this type of experiment and as suggested by Carney et al. <!-- enter citations -->, we used a cover story to keep our research question hidden from participants. The study was advertised as a usability study for a touchscreen game. Participants were unaware of the different interface layouts since posture was manipulated between subjects, making it more difficult for them to guess the real purpose of the study.</p>

	<h3>Procedure</h3>

	<p>Participants were alternately assigned in order of arrival to either the constrictive or the expansive condition. After signing an informed consent form for the “usability study”, participants were introduced to the tabletop setup and asked to go through the on-screen instructions of the game. They were informed that the amount of their compensation would depend on the number of points they achieved in the game. They then pumped up 30 balloons. Once finished, they filled a questionnaire on their level of comfort during the game (12 items), and the BIS-11 impulsivity test  <!-- enter citations --> (30 items). Finally, participants filled a separate form to receive a cinema voucher for their participation. The value of the voucher was between 13e and 20e, depending on how many points they accumulated in the game following the original BART protocol  <!-- enter citations -->. The entire experiment lasted about 20 min.</p>

	<h3>Analysis</h3>

	<p>We analyze our data using Bayesian estimation, through a robust linear model using as likelihood a heteroskedastic scaled and shifted t distribution with degrees of freedom ν. We assume our data to be drawn from two groups, with different means: μ = α<sub>0</sub> + βx, where x = 0 for the constrictive (baseline) condition and x = 1 for the expansive condition. Thus, the difference between the two conditions is given by β. We use this method for the robust analysis of metric data in nominal groups with weakly informed priors which help to avoid inflated effect sizes. This model also allows us to set priors on the difference between the two conditions, β, to be skeptical i.e. set the mean at zero with a small variance; or to be optimistic i.e. set either a positive or negative mean depending on what we believe the effect of the treatment condition to be. Our analysis setup can be seen as a Bayesian analog to a standard ANOVA analysis yet without the prerequisites of an ANOVA, normality and equal variances, and with the possibility of accepting the null hypothesis if the posterior credibility for parameter ranges falls into a pre-defined region of practical equivalence (ROPE)</p>

	<img id="model" src="figures/model.png" width="100%"><figcaption>Data Anslysis model specification<span label="model"></span></figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

	<p>We ran our models with 4 different sets of priors for β, which are a combination of skeptical (ceneterd around 0) and optimistic (ceneterd around a value informed by prior literature), and narrow (low variance, highly regularized) and wide (high variance, weakly regularized), based on the degree of informedness, and the strength of belief. For the optimistic priors, we can use the effect-size for Carney et. al.'s original study (d = ~0.6) or the effect-size from the meta-analysis (d = ~0.23) as the mean for the Normal distribution. In this example, we use the d = 0.6 to calculate the mean of the optimistic priors.</p>
	<p>Thus the 4 sets of priors for β, and the weights assigned to each are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Skeptical, narrow: N(0, 4): <span data-var="weight_skeptical_narrow" data-format="pretty_percent"></span></li>
		<li>Optimistic, narrow: N(9, 4): <span data-var="weight_optimistic_narrow" data-format="pretty_percent"></span></li>
		<li>Skeptical, wide: N(0, 20): <span data-var="weight_skeptical_wide" data-format="pretty_percent"></span></li>
		<li>Optimistic, wide: N(9, 20): <span data-var="weight_optimistic_wide" data-format="pretty_percent"></span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>By default, each priors are equally weighted. Below, you can interact with the weights for the priors to obtain the posterior for a mixture of these 4 sets of priors.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Skeptical 
			<span class="weight-set" data-var="weight_to_skeptic" data-format="pretty_percent"></span> - 
			<span data-var="weight_to_optim" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0" data-max="100" data-step="2"data-format="pretty_percent"></span>
		Optimistic</li>
		<li>Narrow 
			<span class="weight-set" data-var="weight_to_narrow" data-format="pretty_percent"></span> - 
			<span data-var="weight_to_wide" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0" data-max="100" data-step="2"data-format="pretty_percent"></span> 
		Wide</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Implementation: obtaining posterior estimates for mixture priors</h2>
	<p>First, we fit the bayesian model described above using each of the 4 priors used to get 4 posterior distributions. We then calculate the marginal likelihood for each posterior distribution which allow us to calculate the posterior weights. Using the prior weights, w<sup>(0)</sup><sub>j</sub>, (where, j indexes each set of priors), we obtain the posterior weights, w<sup>(1)</sup> according to the formula:</p>
	<figure class="l-body">
		<img id="weights" src="figures/weights.png" width="10%"><figcaption>Posterior weight calculation<span label="weights"></span></figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>where, C<sub>j</sub> is the log-likelihood for each distribution.</p>
	<p>Using these posterior weights, we calculated the weighted density estimates for each posterior distribution to obtain the mixture posterior distribution.</p>
	<p>We fit the models to calculate each posterior distribution, and marginal log-likelihoods in R, and have provided R functions in the supplementary materials which accepts as parameters the observed data (as a list), the different sets of priors (as a data.frame) and bayesian model (as a stanmodel). Currently we support only rstan but we can expand this to include models from other bayesian packages as well.</p>

	<h2>Discussion & Conclusion</h2>
	<p>In Carney et. al.'s initial paper, the authors claimed to have found a strong effect of power poses on risk taking (d = 0.6). However, multiple replications of the original study have failed to find an effect. A researcher, who is trying to replicate the initial study;s findings with a Bayesian analysis, is faced with the question of what priors to use. One can use an uninformative prior or an informative prior. One can also model one's belief in the strength of these priors. However, performing an analysis with just one of these priors might lead to a biased result.</p>
	<p>To illustrate this, let's consider a couple of possible scenarios where an author is performing the replication analysis. In the first scenario, unknown to this author, the findings of the original study, by chance, chose a very unusual sample. The informed prior knowledge happens to be bad. The sample for the second study is reasonably representative. The author does not know what to do, so they drop the informative prior from their research. As it works out, this is fortunate because the happenstance of drawing an unusual sample is now avoided.</p>
	<p>In the second example, unknown to the author, the data collected for the first study happens to be very representative of the data. Thus, using the resulting posterior as an informative prior for the replication study would be a good decision. Unfortunately, when they perform the second experiment, by chance, they happen to draw a very unusual sample. They compare the results with the two priors and drop the one with the informative prior. Unfortunately, they now have a very biased set of parameter estimates because they are unaware that they have drawn a strange sample.</p>
	<p>This example illustrates the benefit of using multiple priors in the analysis and reporting the results from these multiple priors. The authors can then defend why they believe that one prior is superior for the analysis compared to the others. An explorable multiverse analysis, which would allow the readers to set the weights between these different priors provides an additional layer of transparency to the authors' decisions.</p>
	<p>In this example, we observe that the effect size estimated in the original study <dt-cite key="carney2010power"></dt-cite> has been overestimated, and using optimistic priors based on the original study would result in a biased posterior estimate in the replication study. Instead, using uninformed, skeptical or very weakly informative priors may be more appropriate. The results of the repplication find no effect of incidental power poses on risk-taking behavior.</p>
