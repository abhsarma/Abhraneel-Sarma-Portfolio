	<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
	<p>The concept of power pose originates from a Psychology study from 2010 which suggested that holding an expansive pose can change hormone levels and increase risk-taking behavior. Follow-up experiments suggested that expansive poses incidentally imposed by the design of an environment lead to more dishonest behaviors. Jansen and Hornbæk applied the concept in the form of incidental power poses within HCI and reported an at best very small effect.</p>
	<p>In this article we re-analyze the data of their second experiment to consider different priors varying on two dimensions: degree of informedness and strength of belief. We discuss the robustness of the Jansen and Hornbæk's findings in light of our extended analysis.</p>

	<h2 id="experiment">Experiment: Inclined Tabletop</h2>

	<p>Our experiment is inspired by experiment 2 from Yap et. al <dt-cite key="yap2013ergonomics"></dt-cite>. There, participants’ incidental posture was imposed by either arranging their tools around a large (0.6 m<sup>2</sup>) or a small (0.15 m<sup>2</sup>) workspace. Yap et al. study investigated the effect of incidental postures imposed by the different workspaces on people’s dishonesty, whereas we applied the paradigm to risk-taking behavior which is a common behavioral measure in multiple studies on explicit power poses <dt-cite key="cesario2013bodies,carney2010power,ranehill2015assessing"></dt-cite>. These previous studies all gave binary choices to participants, asking them whether they were willing to take a single gamble <dt-cite key="cesario2013bodies,carney2010power"></dt-cite> or to make several risky choices in both gain and loss domain  <dt-cite key="ranehill2015assessing"></dt-cite> using examples taken from Tversky and Kahneman <dt-cite key="tversky1981framing"></dt-cite>. There, participants’ binary response was the measure for risk-taking. We opted for a more continuous measure for risk-taking as it results in higher resolution for responses, and used the balloon analog risk task (BART), a behavioral measure for risk-taking propensity  <dt-cite key="lejuez2002evaluation"></dt-cite>. We again study one main factor: incidental posture with two levels, expansive and constrictive, implemented as two variations of the same graphical user interface <span class="highlight">(see Figure 7)</span>. To keep comfort constant across conditions, we used a slightly inclined 60” tabletop display instead of a wall display so that participants in both conditions could rest their arms while performing the task <span class="highlight">(see Figure 1C&D)</span>.</p>

	<h3>Participants</h3>

	<p>We recruited a total of 80 participants (42 women, 38 men, mean age 26) in two batches. Similar to experiment 1, we initially recruited 40 participants. A Bayes factor analysis <!-- enter citations --> at that point indicated that our data was not sensitive enough to draw any conclusions, and we decided to increase the total number of participants to 80. As is common in this type of experiment and as suggested by Carney et al. <!-- enter citations -->, we used a cover story to keep our research question hidden from participants. The study was advertised as a usability study for a touchscreen game. Participants were unaware of the different interface layouts since posture was manipulated between subjects, making it more difficult for them to guess the real purpose of the study.</p>

	<h3>Procedure</h3>

	<p>Participants were alternately assigned in order of arrival to either the constrictive or the expansive condition. After signing an informed consent form for the “usability study”, participants were introduced to the tabletop setup and asked to go through the on-screen instructions of the game. They were informed that the amount of their compensation would depend on the number of points they achieved in the game. They then pumped up 30 balloons. Once finished, they filled a questionnaire on their level of comfort during the game (12 items), and the BIS-11 impulsivity test  <!-- enter citations --> (30 items). Finally, participants filled a separate form to receive a cinema voucher for their participation. The value of the voucher was between 13e and 20e, depending on how many points they accumulated in the game following the original BART protocol  <!-- enter citations -->. The entire experiment lasted about 20 min.</p>

	<h3>Analysis</h3>

	<p>We analyze our data using Bayesian estimation, through a robust linear model described by Kruschke et. al. <dt-cite key="kruschke2013bayesian"></dt-cite> using as likelihood a heteroskedastic, scaled and shifted t distribution with degrees of freedom ν. Our model can be interpreted as a Bayesian t-test, but without the prerequisites of normality and equal variances, and with the possibility of accepting the null hypothesis if the posterior credibility for parameter ranges falls into a pre-defined region of practical equivalence (ROPE).</p>
	<p>We assume our data to be drawn from two groups, with different means: μ = α<sub>0</sub> + βx, where x = 0 for the constrictive (baseline) condition and x = 1 for the expansive condition. Thus, the difference between the two conditions is given by β. We use this method for the robust analysis of metric data in nominal groups.</p>

	<figure class="l-body">
	<img id="model" src="figures/model.png" width="100%"><figcaption>Data Anslysis model specification<span label="model"></span></figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>where,<ul class="nomargin-list">
		<li>y<sub>i</sub> indicates the number of pumps for each participant, i</li>
		<li>x<sub>i</sub> indicates the group (expansive or constrictive) for each participant, i</li>
		<li>ν indicates the degrees of freedom</li>
		<li>μ indicates the mean of the t-distribution corresponding to each group</li>
		<li>σ<sub>y</sub> indicates the variance of the t-distribution corresponding to each group</li>
		<li>β indicates the mean difference in the number of pumps between the two groups</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>A Bayesian analysis allows us to model our beliefs about the effect of our conditions through the use of priors. Here, our primary parameter of interest is β (the mean difference between the two conditions) and we set a prior on this (as well as other) parameters. A prior, which is a normal distribution in this case, is determined by the following: (1) One's degree of optimism / skepticism about an effect by manipulating the location of the mean; setting the mean at zero indicates a skeptical prior, setting the mean at a value derived from prior literature indicates an optimistic prior. (2) One's strength of belief which can be manipulated by the variance of the normal distribution; setting a narrow prior indicates strong belief about the presence or absence of an effect, a wide prior indicates weak belief about the presence or absence of an effect).</p>

	<p>In this paper, we run our analysis using 4 different sets of prior for β, and take a mixture of these priors - which results in an unique prior. We show the estimates for the posterior probability distribution of β calculated using this mixture distribution of priors. We allow the reader to interact with the prior weights to set their own prior on the primary parameter of interest, β (the mean difference between the two conditions). Our priors are a combination of skeptical (ceneterd at 0) and optimistic (centered at a value informed by prior literature), and narrow (low variance, highly regularized) and wide (high variance, weakly regularized), based on the degree of informedness, and the strength of belief. For the optimistic priors, we <!-- can use the effect-size for Carney et. al.'s original study (d = ~0.6) or --> use the effect-size from the meta-analysis (d = ~0.23), to calculate the mean for the Normal distribution.</p>

	<p>As per <dt-cite key="kruschke2013bayesian"></dt-cite>, we also define a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) around the null value (mean difference of zero), which <i>"encloses those values of the parameter that are deemed to be negligibly different from the null value for practical purposes."</i> Since an effect size of 0.2 is considered to be small, we define the interval on β, which would correspond to an effect size of 0.2: [-3.03, 3.03].</p>

	<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
	<p>Thus the 4 sets of priors for β, and the weights assigned to each are:</p>
	<ul class="nomargin-list">
		<li>Skeptical, narrow: N(0, 4): <span data-var="weight_skeptical_narrow" data-format="pretty_percent"></span></li>
		<li>Optimistic, narrow: N(9, 4): <span data-var="weight_optimistic_narrow" data-format="pretty_percent"></span></li>
		<li>Skeptical, wide: N(0, 20): <span data-var="weight_skeptical_wide" data-format="pretty_percent"></span></li>
		<li>Optimistic, wide: N(9, 20): <span data-var="weight_optimistic_wide" data-format="pretty_percent"></span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The outcome of our analysis are the posterior distributions for the parameters in our model. These distributions indicate credible values for the parameters. Below, we show the density for the posterior distribution of β, the media, and highlight the region which falls under the ROPE. You can interact with the weights for the priors to obtain the posterior for a mixture of these 4 sets of priors.</p>
	<ul class="nomargin-list">
		<li>Skeptical 
			<span class="weight-set" data-var="weight_to_skeptic" data-format="pretty_percent"></span> - 
			<span data-var="weight_to_optim" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0" data-max="100" data-step="2"data-format="pretty_percent"></span>
		Optimistic</li>
		<li>Narrow 
			<span class="weight-set" data-var="weight_to_narrow" data-format="pretty_percent"></span> - 
			<span data-var="weight_to_wide" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0" data-max="100" data-step="2"data-format="pretty_percent"></span> 
		Wide</li>
	</ul>

	<figure class="double-column">
		<div id="graph"></div>
		<figcaption>A figure caption.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>Our results indicate that the probability of our estimate, β, being within the ROPE is <span data-var="ROPE" data-format="pretty_percent"></span>, with the median value being <span data-var="median_beta"></span>.</p>

	<h2>Discussion & Conclusion</h2>
	<p>In Carney et. al.'s initial paper, the authors claimed to have found a strong effect of power poses on risk taking (d = 0.6)<dt-cite key="carney2010power"></dt-cite>. However, multiple replications of the original study have failed to find an effect. A researcher, who is trying to replicate the initial study's findings with a Bayesian analysis, is faced with the question of what priors to use. One can use an uninformative prior or an informative prior. One can also model one's belief in the strength of these priors. However, performing an analysis with just one of these priors might lead to a biased result.</p>

	<p>Hence, in our analysis, we used multiple priors to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameter, β. We see that, regardless of the prior used, the median value is always in the interval [-1, 1], and the probability that the parameter lies within ROPE is always greater than 50%. However, our results also show that using a more optimistic prior, calculated from the effect size proposed in the original study <dt-cite key="carney2010power"></dt-cite> and Yap et. al.'s work <dt-cite key="yap2013ergonomics"></dt-cite> would have resulted in biased estimates, as the reported effect sizes in those studies have been overestimated. Thus, using uninformed, skeptical or very weakly informative priors may be more appropriate for this analysis.</p>
	
	<p>Our experiment found that incidental body posture did not predict participants' behavior, and this is consistent with the findings of the recent replications which elicited postures explicitly. The results of our replication find no effect of incidental power poses on risk-taking behavior, leading us to conclude that incidental power poses are unlikely to produce measurable differences in risk-taking behavior when tested across a diverse population.</p>
